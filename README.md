# Continuous training

This repository aims to manage the tasks for studying additional tech and inspirational content from books, conferences, articles, and other sources. The expected output is to report the study and have a single spot to go over and extend the content over time.

## Motivation

- Attend conferences, talks, read books and learn new stuff over Internet develop a prolearner aptitude.

- Knowledge acquisition is better accomplished in several iterations, not only by reading or watching but also writing and mapping the information.

- Delegate every content on the mind is ineffective. Delegate every content on paper is prone to get lost. Delegate every content in the cloud improves durability, availability and revision.

- Github serves to accomplish content management in the cloud efficiently. Besides, it adds task management and traceability.
