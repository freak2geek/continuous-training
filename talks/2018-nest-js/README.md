# Nest-js

*When: 31-05-2018*, *Where: Valencia*

Nest-js talk to understand better a server-side framework based on Java environment but in Javascript.

## Expectations

- Learn about an infrastructure that is closed to Java environments in terms of project structure and conventions, patterns, typed system and IDE integration. Is worth to adopt Java ecosystem on a Javascript environment?

- Understand how the server approach can be adopted in the client in the same fashion. Is angular inspired for nes-js as the client-side library?
