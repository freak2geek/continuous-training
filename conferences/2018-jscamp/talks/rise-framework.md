*When: 19-07-2018 | 11:20 - 12:00*, *Where: Barcelona*

Speakers: [Mike Hartington](https://jscamp.tech/speakers/mike-hartington)

## Expectations

- Get an overview about the state of JS by going through the past, present and future.

- Get ideas on how to improve the decision making of technologies and their configuration. [Too many decisions](https://monosnap.com/file/NMHaWqi5YPSNuUngXsEfHUOhrjov9Z) and then config files...

## Talk ideas

- Frustrating too many decision to make a new project.
- Finding balance point from the webstandars.
- CSS (global styles, dynamic values), Javascript, Components: Styling, scripting and building blocks.

Native solutions for:

- CSS

Global styles, can affect any component in the DOM, cascade becomes difficult to reason, Reset become a thing.
CSS-In-JS, CSS modules x. Shadow DOM, isolate component internals, css is scoped, no more global, simplified rules.
Dynamic values - CSS variables, theming.

- Javascript

Evolves so fast. Fatigue on configure your enviroment. Consider old browser support. Use native module notation `<script type="module" />`.

- Components.

React VS Angular VS Vue. Different Framework and API.
Support natively, the CUSTOM ELEMENTS, no framework needed.
Natively support may be functional but is a hard syntax to work out.

Frameworks like Angular, Vue try to translate a framework-specific component definition into a native WebComponent. React isn't shipping this feature for the moment.

- Frameworks are not going last forever. What can do webstandards today?
