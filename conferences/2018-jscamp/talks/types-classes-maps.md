*When: 19-07-2018 | 12:00 - 12:40*, *Where: Barcelona*

Speakers: [Benedikt Meurer](https://jscamp.tech/speakers/benedikt-meurer)

## Expectations

- Become aware deeply of JavaScript engines in modern browsers, Node, and Electron. Understanding and possibilities.

## Talk ideas

- Invest time to learn JS is worth, JS is used everywhere. Browsers, node, and many applications nowdays.

JS source code => parser => abstract sytax tree => interpreter (produces bycode) => optimizing compiler => optimized code (machine code).

- Different compiler components and flows on JS engines, produce different performance impacts.

- Generate code quickly vs generating quick code, optimization level vs memory usage

- Do not mess with prototypes.
