# Shared settings

To use the shared configuration file prepared to work optimally with VSCode you need to:

- Install the ["Settings Sync"](extensions.md#settings-sync) extension.

- Follow the instructions to ["Download the settings"](https://github.com/shanalikhan/code-settings-sync#download-your-settings) section.

- Use "93e0952f730be165c3752c069352366a" as the Gist ID for the settings.
