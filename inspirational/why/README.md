# Why

## Introduction [TO WRITE]

## Simon Sinek vision

- There are two ways to influence the behavior: manipulation and inspiration. The former is based on an outside-in strategy, which drives the influence from facts and language. The latter is based on an inside-out strategy, which transmits the causes and beliefs with the aim to influence in a emotional way inducing to trust, excitement, commitment and loyalty.

- Both strategies are depicted in [the golden globe](#the-golden-word-cloud), whose core correspond to the "why" and the outer layers being "how" and "what". The outside-in strategy parts from the "what" to the "how", keeping on the details, evidences and results to influence on the behavior, the clearest things. The inside-out strategy is originated from the "why" or the fuzziest thing to the "how" and "what", in other words from the causes and beliefs up to the differences and facts.

- Start with "why" helps to understand the purpose of a process, developing clarity on a goal to achieve. But apart from helping to individuals and organizations, its trasmition may attract other people with an emotional commitment.

- There is a biological exposition around this topic and is related on how the brain is structured and works. The golden globe matches with the brain parts, the core correspond to the limbic system, which is the one in charge for emotions and decision making, and the outer layers are the neocortex, which fits with the rational thinking and language. Therefore, starting with the "why" is to operate directly on what drives the decisions and commitments.

- Who focus in "why" may be seen as a visionary, while who do with "how" and "what" as an operator.
